README

To get this application up and running I created a new repository, a new rails project for my [places to eat in gulf breeze](http://labrisarestaurant.com/) website and followed all the steps from the GitHub site. I am still a beginner, but I'm learning quickly.

Someone told me that you can create great websites through this platform so I'm willing to try this. I want to make a dynamic, secure site that I can also rank easier on the search engines. The web is such a cool place to build an audience and we had a lot of success lately. I wish you all the best and I invite you to pay us a visit when you're around!
